Tries to change the weight of a face that doesn't exist. ... ok
test_003_die_change_weight (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)
Tries to change the weight of a face to an invalid value. ... ok
test_004_die_roll (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)
Ensures that only valid faces end up in the roll's output. ... ok
test_005_die_roll (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)
Ensures that the output list has a length equal to the "n" parameter. ... ok
test_006_die_get_df (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)
Ensures that the method returns a DataFrame with correct values. ... ok
test_007_die_get_name (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)

Confirms that the init method correctly sets the weights array to 1.0 values of a correct length. ... ok
test_100_game_init (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)
Checks that length of created dice attribute matches length of input array. Input array has identical dice. ... ok
test_101_game_init (__main__.MontecarloTestSuite)
Attempts to pass in dice containing different faces. Ensures that no dice attribute is assigned due to the incorrect input. ... ok
